* Description

A nix flake that installs Pianoteq8 on nixos. The license key and binary are still required and
have to be acquired manually from https://www.modartt.com/.

*NOTE:* You can also install older versions by selecting the respective ~tag~ from the ~branch~ dropdown.

* Usage

Right now, I am really new to NixOS and Nix so this might be an awkward way of installing a package.
I might try to enhance this in the future and maybe even put it in the NUR.

1. Download the ~pianoteq_linux_v841.7z~ file from https://www.modartt.com/
2. Put ~pianoteq_linux_v841.7z~ into the nix store

#+begin_src sh :results output scalar
nix store add-file ./pianoteq_linux_v841.7z
#+end_src

3. In your main flake.nix file add the following line to your inputs

#+begin_src nix :results output scalar
inputs = {
  #...
  pianoteq.url = "github:qhga/nix-pianoteq";
  #...
};
#+end_src

4. Use the following in order to install the package

#+begin_src nix :results output scalar
  environment.systemPackages = [
    #...
    pianoteq.packages.x86_64-linux.default
    #...
  ];
#+end_src

* Add a new Version

1. Download the new release from https://www.modartt.com/
2. Get the new sha256 hash in sri format

#+begin_src sh :results output scalar
nix hash to-sri --type sha256 `sha256sum pianoteq_linux_$NEW_VERSION.7z | awk '{print $1}'`
#+end_src

3. Change the version numbers in the flake.nix file and adjust the sha256 hash

#+begin_src nix :results output scalar
        src = requireFile {
          name = "pianoteq_linux_$NEW_VERSION.7z";
          message = "Download the file from: https://www.modartt.com/download?file=pianoteq_linux_$NEW_VERSION.7z and add it to the nix store manually: nix store add-file ./pianoteq_linux_$NEW_VERSION.7z";
          sha256 = "$NEW_HASH";
        };
#+end_src

4. Put the new release 7z into the nix store

#+begin_src sh :results output scalar
nix store add-file ./pianoteq_linux_$NEW_VERSION.7z
#+end_src
